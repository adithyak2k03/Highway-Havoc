# Highway Havoc - Car Game

A simple Car game build using HTML, CSS, and JS


Works to do:
- ~~On Refresh, sky moves left, Fix that~~
- Add coins and rocks(and obstacles), and collision mechanics.
- Score card (current score and high score(highlight/ celebrate when high score is crossed) )
- A modal when losing (Hitting obstacles)
- ~~Instruction icon, on press opens a modal and pauses the game and gives instruction.~~
- Different ~~car models~~ and background scenaries amd roads.
- Radio button in corner that plays random old car related songs in the page
- ~~Change to proper and smooth car and wheel images (now there are some issues with the wheel images).~~
